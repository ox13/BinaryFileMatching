# README: Sample Output

Note: the TestFilePairs.txt will contain more than 20 file pairs. This is because of where the print function is placed in the test generator script. (i.e., the generator queues up additional data that is never used by the deep learning model and this queued data is also printed to the file.)

ONLY THE FIRST 20 FILE PAIRS SHOULD BE USED FOR COMPARISON WITH THE PREDICTIONS.TXT FILE.
